## Backend Service: Problems, Benefits and Impacts

### Problems It Will Solve

One of the main problems that implementing a backend service for the Travel Info application will solve would be the inability of a user to make use of the application in the same way on different devices. This is because currently the only way that the application retains information is by storing it in the local storage of the device. This means that if the user started using the application and saving some locations on one device, but then wanted to access those same favourites on another device, they would not be able to do so, since the local storage of the two devices are not connected. By implementing a backend service, we will be able to store the users favourites in a central remote database that would allow them to be accessed from any device if they provide the correct credentials.

Another of the problems that implementing a backend service for the Travel Info application will solve would be the concern of users that the Travel Info app should be more personalised to their needs. Currently, the application does not have any way of knowing who the user is, and therefore cannot provide any personalised information. By implementing a backend service, we will be able to create a user authentication feature that would allow the application to be aware of who the user is, and would therefore be able to provide them with a more personalised experience. This initially would apply mainly to the saving of favourite locations to an external database, but could be expanded to include other features in the future, for instance, the ability to save a user's search history, or to provide them with recommendations based on their previous searches.

### Benefits To The User

The main benefit to the user of implementing a backend service for the Travel Info application would be the ability to access their favourite locations from any device. This would mean that if a user started using the application on one device, but then wanted to access their favourites on another device, they would be able to do so, since the favourites would be stored in a central remote database. This would help incentivise users to use the application more often, as they would be able to use the application at home and on the move, which is when users are most likely to need to use a weather forecast application, and would also make the application more appealing to the user as they would not have to save locations to their favourites on multiple devices in order to access them on the go.

### Impact On The Business

One of the main impacts on DFCorp of implementing a backend service for the Travel Info application would be that it would open up the company to the possibility of creating backend services for other applications, for instance the Banking app, which would make it far better for the user as they would now be able to use it across multiple devices. This would also make the company more appealing to potential customers, as they would be able to offer a more comprehensive service.

Another of the impacts of implementing a backend service for the Travel Info app would be that it would open the company up to the dangers of hosting a database of user information. This means that DFCorp would have to be extremely careful when it comes to the security of the database, as if it were to be hacked then the company would be liable for any damages that were caused. DFCorp would have to invest a great deal of time and money in the security of their backend services, which would be a significant cost to the company.
